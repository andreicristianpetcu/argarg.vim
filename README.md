argarg.vim
==========

Seriously dumb plugin that loads all your project files `git ls-files` into your args list.

Just add this to your vimrc

```
Plug 'andreicristianpetcu/argarg.vim'
```

Or you can use any other plugin manager.
I use this plugin in tandem with CtrlPLine so I can search all the lines in all the files.
